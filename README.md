# SpongeSearch
SpongeSearch is a web app that allows you to search across multiple episode transcripts of *SpongeBob SquarePants* for any specific dialogue (keywords, phrases, etc...).

This project was inspired by a Python script/app that was showcased by *SpongeDubs* on one of their YouTube videos.

**Link:** TBA

## How It's Made:

- **Front-end Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap.
- **Back-end Tech:** Express, MongoDB, and Python (to an extent).

A Python script was used to scrape most dialogue from transcripts on the *Encyclopedia SpongeBobia* wikia site and insert them into a MongoDB database.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

# Running Locally
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curtistry/sponge-search
   ```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a .zip and extract it somewhere

2. Navigate to the server and install packages/dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server.

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   
4. Navigate to the client and install packages/dependencies.
This should be done in a new terminal.

   ```

6. Run the client.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
