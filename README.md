# SpongeSearch

*April 7, 2025 - Present*

**SpongeSearch** is a web app that allows you to search across multiple episode transcripts of *SpongeBob SquarePants* for any specific dialogue (keywords, phrases, etc...).

This project was inspired by a Python script/app that was showcased by *SpongeDubs* on one of their YouTube videos.

**Demo Link:** https://sponge-search.vercel.app/

## How It's Made:

- **Front-end Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite, React, and Bootstrap.
- **Back-end Tech:** JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, and Python (to an extent).

All transcript dialogue is stored in a MongoDB database.
A Python script (requests + BeautifulSoup4) was used to scrape the data from transcripts on the *Encyclopedia SpongeBobia* wikia site and insert them into the database.

## Optimizations
*[Work in Progress]*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Running Locally
1. **Clone this repository to your local machine.**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curtistry/sponge-search
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a .zip and extract it somewhere

2. **Navigate to the server and install packages/dependencies.**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server.**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   
4. **Navigate to the client and install packages/dependencies.**

   This should be done in a new terminal.

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the client.**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
## Lessons Learned:
*[Work in Progress]*
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
